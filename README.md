Scripts to detect artifacts and in electrodermal activity (EDA) data. Note that these scripts are written in Python 2.7.

Required python packages: 
===
- numpy: 1.9.2 
- scipy: 0.14.0 
- pandas: 0.16.0
- sklearn: 0.16.1
- pickle 
- matplotlib: 1.3.1 
- imp
- PyWavelets: 0.2.2
- os

To run artifact detection from the command line:
==
python EDA-Artifact-Detection-Script.py

Note that PickleDirectory is the main directory

Currently there are only 2 classifiers to choose from: Binary or Multiclass

To run peak detection:
==
python EDA-Peak-Detection-Script.py

Descriptions of the algorithm settings can be found at http://eda-explorer.media.mit.edu/info/

To run accelerometer feature extraction:
==
python AccelerometerFeatureExtractionScript.py

This file works slightly differently than the others in that it gives summary information over periods of time.

Notes:
===

1. Currently, these files are written with the assumption that the sample rate is an integer power of 2. 

2. Keep the "classify.py" and "SVMBinary.p" and "SVMMulticlass.p" files in the same directory.
